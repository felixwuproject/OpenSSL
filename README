Instructions

Download the encrypted message onto your virtual machine using wget:

Run: wget tinyurl.com/s99665v to download the file.

Rename the s99665v file you have downloaded, to communication.txt.enc.

Run: mv s99665v communication.txt.enc to rename the file.

Download the Key and IV

Run: wget tinyurl.com/yx8boxpp to download the file.
Run: cat yx8boxpp to read the file.


Note: You'll need to copy parts of this file for the command that you will be using.


Use OpenSSL with the key and IV provided to decrypt the message.


Use the following options when decrypting:

-pbkdf2
-nosalt
-aes-256-cbc
-base64



Follow the instructions provided in the decrypted message

From the command line write the following command to decrypt the message:
openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -d -in communication.txt.enc -base64 -K 346B3EFB4B899E8205C4B35E91F5A4605A54F89730AE65CA2C43AB464E76CA99 -iv 759D1B9BF335985F55E3E9940E751B67


The decrypted message will display the following:
From: Captain Strickland

Great Job cracking all the Alphabet's coded messages so far, but we need to act faster.

I need you and your partner to meet me at Lou's Cafe tomorrow at noon.
I have some additional information to share about the Alphabet Bandit.

I need you to do the following things:

1) Write a message called "meetingplace.txt" for your partner, letting them know about the secret meeting tomorrow 
2) In the message don't use your real names!
3) Create a new Key and IV with Open SSL
4) Use Open SSL with that Key and IV to encrypt the message
5) Don't send the message until we give you the green light




To complete the first step, create a message called meetingplace.txt that includes a message similar to the following:
Hi [partner's code name], this is [your code name]. Tomorrow we will be meeting Captain Strickland at noon at Lou's Cafe to discuss some additional information about the Alphabet Bandit


To create a the new key and IV, run the following:
openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -k [password here] -P > key_and_IV


View the key and IV and and use the data to encrypt the message with the following command:
openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -in meetingplace.txt -out meetingplace.txt.enc -base64 -K <key> -iv <iv>


Validate the encrypted message has been created by running:
cat meetingplace.txt.enc
